django-apikey

Simple, straight forward API key authentication for django-piston.

Requirements (can be install with pip install -r requirements.txt):
django-piston
Using django.contrib.auth

You can install into a virtualenv and run the tests:
./manage.py test key --settings="key.settings"

There is a simple template file in templates/keys.html.  This file is used
by all the project's views.


To use django-apikey with django-piston:

from key.auth import ApiKeyAuthentication
auth = ApiKeyAuthentication( )
bucket_handler = Resource( handler=MyHandler, authentication=auth )


By default, clients use the X-Api-Authorization header to pass the API key:

headers['X-Api-Authorization'] = 'your.api.key.here'

This can be modified in the settings.py of your Django project by using the APIKEY_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER setting, e.g.:

APIKEY_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER = 'X-MyCoolApp-Authorization'

This setting defaults to the X-Api-Authorization header.

The numer of keys that a User can be defined in your project's settings.py. \  
Setting APIKEY_MAX_KEYS to a positive integer will create a limit on the number of keys an individual User can create.  Setting it to -1 allows Users to create an
unlimited number of keys.

APIKEY_MAX_KEYS = -1

For example, this will allow a User to make an unlimited number of keys.

You can control the length of the key by setting APIKEY_KEY_SIZE.  Currently, there is a maximum
key size of 32 characters.
